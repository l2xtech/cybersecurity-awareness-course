        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Email Security Best Practices</h3>
            <p>Email remains one of the primary vectors for cyber attacks. Following these best practices can significantly reduce risks:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Verify Sender Identity</strong>: Check the sender's email address carefully, not just the display name. Look for subtle misspellings or domain variations.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Be Cautious with Attachments</strong>: Only open attachments you're expecting from trusted sources. Verify unexpected attachments through another communication channel before opening.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Check Links Before Clicking</strong>: Hover over links (without clicking) to see the actual URL. If in doubt, navigate to the website directly rather than clicking the link.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Use Email Encryption</strong>: When sending sensitive information, use encrypted email services or encrypt the content itself.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Keep Email Software Updated</strong>: Ensure your email client has the latest security updates and patches.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Use Spam Filters</strong>: Take advantage of your organization's spam filtering tools, and report suspicious emails to improve their effectiveness.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Be Careful with Auto-Forward</strong>: Avoid setting up automatic email forwarding, especially to external addresses, as this can lead to data leakage.</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <p>When in doubt about an email's legitimacy, contact the purported sender through a different channel (phone call, in-person visit) to verify.</p>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Identifying Suspicious Messages</h3>
            <p>Suspicious emails often contain telltale signs. Here's what to look for:</p>
            
            <h4>Red Flags in Email Communications</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Urgent or Threatening Language</strong>: Messages creating a sense of urgency or threatening negative consequences if immediate action isn't taken.</li>
                <li><strong>Generic Greetings</strong>: "Dear Customer" or "Dear User" instead of your name.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Grammar and Spelling</strong>: Professional organizations typically proofread their communications.</li>
                <li><strong>Mismatched or Suspicious URLs</strong>: Links that don't match the purported organization or use URL shorteners to hide the destination.</li>
                <li><strong>Requests for Sensitive Information</strong>: Legitimate organizations rarely request passwords, account numbers, or personal information via email.</li>
                <li><strong>Unexpected Attachments</strong>: Especially those with unusual file extensions (.exe, .zip, .scr).</li>
                <li><strong>Too Good to Be True</strong>: Offers, prizes, or opportunities that seem unrealistically generous.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
                <p>A finance employee received an email appearing to be from the CEO requesting an urgent wire transfer to a new vendor. The email address looked legitimate at first glance, but closer inspection revealed a slight variation from the CEO's actual address. The employee followed protocol by verifying the request through a phone call to the CEO, discovering it was fraudulent. This type of attack, known as CEO fraud or Business Email Compromise (BEC), has cost organizations billions of dollars worldwide.</p>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Secure File Sharing Methods</h3>
            <p>Sharing files securely is essential for protecting sensitive information. Here are recommended methods:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Company-Approved Cloud Storage</strong>: Use organization-sanctioned platforms like SharePoint, Google Workspace, or OneDrive for Business.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Encrypted File Sharing</strong>: Use tools that encrypt files during transfer and storage.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Password-Protected Files</strong>: For sensitive documents, use password protection and share the password through a different communication channel.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)</strong>: For large or numerous files, SFTP provides encrypted file transfer capabilities.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Expiring Access Links</strong>: Use services that allow you to set expiration dates for shared links.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Digital Rights Management (DRM)</strong>: For highly sensitive documents, consider DRM solutions that control who can view, edit, or share files.</p>
            
            <h4>Insecure Methods to Avoid</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Email Accounts</strong>: These often lack enterprise-grade security features.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer File Sharing Services</strong>: Unless approved by IT, avoid using personal accounts on services like Dropbox or WeTransfer.</li>
                <li><strong>Unencrypted USB Drives</strong>: Physical devices can be lost or stolen, compromising data.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Wi-Fi</strong>: Avoid transferring sensitive files when connected to public networks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Use Approved Platforms</strong>: Only use messaging applications approved by your organization.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Enable Encryption</strong>: Ensure end-to-end encryption is activated when available.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Be Mindful of Screen Sharing</strong>: During video calls or screen sharing, be careful not to expose sensitive information.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Verify Recipients</strong>: Double-check group chat participants before sharing sensitive information.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Don't Store Sensitive Information</strong>: Avoid keeping confidential data in chat histories.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Update Regularly</strong>: Keep messaging applications updated with the latest security patches.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Use Strong Authentication</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication for messaging accounts.</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <p>Remember that even in "private" chats, information can be captured through screenshots or forwarded to others.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Handling Confidential Information</h3>
            <p>Proper handling of confidential information is crucial for maintaining security and compliance:</p>
            
            <h4>Classification of Information</h4>
            <p>Most organizations classify information into categories such as:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Public</strong>: Information that can be freely shared.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Internal</strong>: Information for employees only, but not particularly sensitive.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Confidential</strong>: Sensitive information that should only be shared with authorized individuals.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Restricted</strong>: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls.</p>
            
            <h4>Guidelines for Handling Different Classifications</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Know Your Organization's Policy</strong>: Familiarize yourself with your company's specific classification system and handling requirements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Label Appropriately</strong>: Ensure documents and emails are clearly labeled with their classification level.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Need-to-Know Basis</strong>: Share confidential information only with those who require it for their work.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Secure Disposal</strong>: Properly dispose of confidential information when no longer needed (shredding physical documents, secure deletion of digital files).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Document Tracking</strong>: For highly sensitive documents, maintain logs of who has accessed them.</p>
            
            <h4>Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</h4>
            <p>Many organizations implement DLP solutions that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor outgoing communications for sensitive information</li>
