            <h3>What is Information Security?</h3>
            <p>Information Security (InfoSec) refers to the practices, policies, and measures designed to protect information assets from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It aims to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, regardless of its format.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Information security is not just about technologyâ€”it encompasses people, processes, and technology working together to protect valuable information assets.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>In today's digital world, information is one of the most valuable assets an organization possesses. This information can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer data</li>
                <li>Financial records</li>
                <li>Intellectual property</li>
                <li>Business strategies</li>
                <li>Employee information</li>
                <li>Operational data</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>The CIA Triad</h3>
            <p>The foundation of information security is built on three key principles, known as the CIA triad:</p>
            
            <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
            <p>Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. This involves protecting sensitive information from unauthorized individuals and systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Encryption, access controls, classification of information</p>
            
            <h4>Integrity</h4>
            <p>Maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Checksums, version control, digital signatures</p>
            
            <h4>Availability</h4>
            <p>Ensuring that information and systems are available when needed by authorized users. Systems, networks, and applications must be functioning as expected and when needed.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Redundancy, backups, disaster recovery plans</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <p>Remember the CIA triad by thinking of it as the "CIA" of security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. All three components must be maintained for effective information security.</p>

            <h3>Why Information Security Matters</h3>
            <p>Information security is critical for several reasons:</p>
            
            <h4>Protection Against Threats</h4>
            <p>Organizations face numerous threats, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cyberattacks (hacking, malware, phishing)</li>
                <li>Data breaches</li>
                <li>Insider threats</li>
                <li>Physical theft or damage</li>
                <li>Human error</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Business Continuity</h4>
            <p>Effective information security ensures that business operations can continue even in the face of security incidents or disasters.</p>
            
            <h4>Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h4>
            <p>Many industries are subject to regulations that mandate specific security controls and practices to protect sensitive information.</p>
            
            <h4>Reputation Management</h4>
            <p>Security breaches can severely damage an organization's reputation and erode customer trust.</p>
            
            <h4>Financial Protection</h4>
            <p>Security incidents can result in significant financial losses due to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remediation costs</li>
                <li>Legal fees and settlements</li>
                <li>Regulatory fines</li>
                <li>Lost business opportunities</li>
                <li>Decreased market value</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Your Role in Information Security</h3>
            <p>Information security is everyone's responsibility, not just the IT department's. As an employee, you play a crucial role in maintaining the security of your organization's information assets.</p>
            
            <p>Your responsibilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Following security policies and procedures</li>
                <li>Being vigilant about potential security threats</li>
                <li>Reporting suspicious activities or security incidents</li>
                <li>Protecting your credentials and access</li>
                <li>Handling sensitive information appropriately</li>
                <li>Participating in security awareness training</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Remember: The strongest security technology can be rendered ineffective by a single careless action. Your awareness and adherence to security practices are essential components of your organization's security posture.</p>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Information Security and ISO 27001</h3>
            <p>ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management. It provides a framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS).</p>
            
            <p>Key aspects of ISO 27001 include:</p>
