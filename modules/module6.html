            <h3>Mobile Device Security Basics</h3>
            <p>Mobile devices present unique security challenges due to their portability, connectivity options, and the variety of apps they can run:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Device Passcodes and Biometrics</strong>: Always secure your device with a strong passcode, fingerprint, or facial recognition.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Screen Lock Timeout</strong>: Set your screen to lock automatically after a short period of inactivity (1-5 minutes).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Device Encryption</strong>: Ensure your device's storage is encrypted to protect data if the device is lost or stolen.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Remote Wipe Capability</strong>: Enable features that allow you to remotely erase your device if it's lost or stolen.</p>
            
            <p><strong>App Permissions</strong>: Regularly review and restrict app permissions to only what's necessary for functionality.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Operating System Updates</strong>: Keep your device's operating system and apps updated with the latest security patches.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Avoid Jailbreaking/Rooting</strong>: These practices bypass built-in security controls and expose devices to additional risks.</p>
            
            <h4>Mobile Threat Landscape</h4>
            <p>Mobile devices face several specific threats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Malicious Apps</strong>: Apps that appear legitimate but contain malware.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Charging Stations</strong>: "Juice jacking" attacks can steal data through charging ports.</li>
                <li><strong>Bluetooth Vulnerabilities</strong>: Unsecured Bluetooth connections can be exploited.</li>
                <li><strong>SMS Phishing (Smishing)</strong>: Text messages designed to trick you into revealing information or installing malware.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsecured Wi-Fi</strong>: Public networks that may expose your data to interception.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Theft</strong>: Loss of devices containing sensitive company information.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
                <p>A sales executive left their company tablet in a taxi while traveling for business. The tablet was not protected with a passcode and contained sensitive client information and access to company email. Before IT could remotely wipe the device, the finder had already accessed confidential sales proposals and client contact information. This incident could have been prevented with basic security measures like device encryption, strong passcode protection, and automatic screen locking.</p>
