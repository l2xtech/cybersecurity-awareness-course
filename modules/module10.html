        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Identifying Security Incidents</h3>
            <p>A security incident is any event that potentially compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or systems. Recognizing these incidents is the first step in effective response:</p>
            
            <h4>Common Types of Security Incidents</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Malware Infections</strong>: Signs include unusual system behavior, unexpected pop-ups, or system slowdowns.</li>
                <li><strong>Phishing Attempts</strong>: Suspicious emails requesting sensitive information or containing unusual links or attachments.</li>
                <li><strong>Unauthorized Access</strong>: Evidence that someone has accessed systems or information without permission.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Breaches</strong>: Indications that sensitive information has been accessed, stolen, or exposed.</li>
                <li><strong>Lost or Stolen Devices</strong>: Missing laptops, smartphones, or other devices containing company information.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Security Breaches</strong>: Unauthorized individuals in secure areas or evidence of tampering with equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Denial of Service</strong>: Systems or services becoming unavailable or unusually slow.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Warning Signs to Watch For</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unusual System Behavior</strong>: Programs crashing, unexpected reboots, or strange error messages.</li>
                <li><strong>Unexpected Changes</strong>: Files or settings that have changed without explanation.</li>
                <li><strong>Suspicious Communications</strong>: Unusual emails, messages, or phone calls requesting information or action.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Issues</strong>: Failed login attempts, account lockouts, or unexpected password changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Unusual Network Activity</strong>: Excessive network traffic or connections to unfamiliar external servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Missing or Altered Data</strong>: Information that has disappeared or been modified unexpectedly.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
                <p>An employee noticed that their computer was running unusually slowly and that the fan was constantly running at high speed. They also observed that the hard drive light was continuously active, even when they weren't using the computer. Rather than dismissing these signs as normal computer issues, they reported them to the IT security team. Investigation revealed that the computer was infected with cryptomining malware that was using system resources to mine cryptocurrency. The early reporting prevented the malware from spreading to other systems and potentially accessing sensitive data.</p>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Reporting Procedures and Channels</h3>
            <p>Knowing how and when to report security incidents is crucial for effective response:</p>
            
            <h4>When to Report</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Immediately</strong>: Report incidents as soon as you notice them, even if you're not certain it's a security issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Better Safe Than Sorry</strong>: It's always better to report a false alarm than to ignore a real incident.</li>
                <li><strong>No Blame Culture</strong>: Organizations should foster an environment where employees feel comfortable reporting incidents without fear of blame.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>How to Report</h4>
            <p><strong>Designated Channels</strong>: Use your organization's established reporting channels, which may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IT helpdesk or support</li>
                <li>Security team email or hotline</li>
                <li>Incident reporting system</li>
                <li>Direct manager or security officer</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Information to Include</strong>:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Your contact information</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Follow-Up</strong>: Be available for additional questions as the investigation proceeds.</p>
            
            <h4>Reporting Template</h4>
            <p>A good incident report should include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Date and Time</strong>: When the incident was discovered</li>
                <li><strong>Reporter Information</strong>: Your name and contact details</li>

            </ol>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <p>When reporting an incident, focus on facts rather than assumptions. Describe exactly what you observed without speculating on causes or blame.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="module-section">

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h5>Case Study 1: Ransomware Attack</h5>
                <p>A manufacturing company experienced a ransomware attack that encrypted critical production systems. The incident was detected when an employee noticed unusual file names and reported them immediately. Thanks to this early detection, the IT team was able to isolate affected systems before the encryption spread throughout the network. While some systems were impacted, the company's regular backups allowed for recovery without paying the ransom. The incident led to improved network segmentation and more frequent backup testing.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h5>Case Study 2: Business Email Compromise</h5>
                <p>A finance employee received an email appearing to be from the CEO requesting an urgent wire transfer. Despite the pressure for immediate action, the employee followed the company's verification procedure for financial requests, discovering it was fraudulent. This prevented a potentially significant financial loss and highlighted the importance of following security procedures even under pressure.</p>
