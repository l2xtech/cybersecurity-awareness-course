            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Passwords are the keys to our digital lives. Despite advances in authentication technology, passwords remain the most common method for securing accounts and systems. In this module, we'll explore how to create strong passwords, manage them effectively, and enhance security through additional authentication methods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Creating Strong Passwords</h3>
            <p>A strong password is your first line of defense against unauthorized access. Here's what makes a password strong:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Length</strong>: Longer passwords are generally more secure. Aim for at least 12-16 characters.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Complexity</strong>: Include a mix of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uppercase letters (A-Z)</li>
                <li>Lowercase letters (a-z)</li>
                <li>Numbers (0-9)</li>
                <li>Special characters (!@#$%^&*)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Unpredictability</strong>: Avoid common words, phrases, or patterns that could be easily guessed.</p>
            
            <h4>Weak vs. Strong Passwords</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Weak Password Examples</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>password123</li>
                <li>qwerty</li>
                <li>123456</li>
                <li>yourname</li>
                <li>birthdates</li>
                <li>company name</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Strong Password Examples</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tr@vel-fr0g-sunset-76!</li>
                <li>P!ck3d*AppL3s^F@ll2023</li>
                <li>Bl4ck&Wh1te$El3phant</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Passphrases: An Alternative Approach</h4>
            
            <p>Instead of complex, hard-to-remember passwords, consider using passphrasesâ€”longer phrases that are meaningful to you but difficult for others to guess:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: "My dog Max loves to chase squirrels in the park!"</p>
            
            <p>This can be transformed into a strong password: "MdMl2cs1tp!"</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <p>Passphrases are often easier to remember than random characters while still providing strong security.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Password Management Tools</h3>
            <p>With dozens of online accounts requiring passwords, it's impossible to create and remember unique, complex passwords for each one without help. This is where password managers come in.</p>
            
            <h4>What is a Password Manager?</h4>
            
            <p>A password manager is a secure application that stores and manages your passwords. It typically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generates strong, random passwords</li>
                <li>Stores passwords in an encrypted vault</li>
                <li>Auto-fills credentials on websites and apps</li>
                <li>Syncs across multiple devices</li>
                <li>Requires one master password to access all others</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Benefits of Password Managers</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Security</strong>: Enables the use of strong, unique passwords for every account.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Convenience</strong>: No need to remember multiple complex passwords.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Organization</strong>: Keeps all your login information in one secure place.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Auto-fill</strong>: Saves time and reduces typing errors.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Security Alerts</strong>: Many password managers alert you to compromised or weak passwords.</p>
            
            <h4>Popular Password Managers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>LastPass</li>
                <li>1Password</li>
                <li>Bitwarden</li>
                <li>Dashlane</li>
                <li>KeePass</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
                <p>In 2019, a major data breach at a popular social media platform exposed millions of user passwords. Users who had unique passwords for this platform limited their risk, as attackers couldn't use the same credentials to access their other accounts. Those using password managers were better protected, as they were more likely to have unique passwords for each service.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
            <p>Even the strongest password can be compromised. Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification beyond just a password.</p>
            
            <h4>What is Multi-Factor Authentication?</h4>
            
            <p>MFA requires two or more verification factors from different categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Something you know</strong> (password, PIN)</li>
                <li><strong>Something you have</strong> (smartphone, security key)</li>
                <li><strong>Something you are</strong> (fingerprint, facial recognition)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Common MFA Methods</h4>
            
            <p><strong>SMS Codes</strong>: One-time codes sent via text message.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Authenticator Apps</strong>: Mobile apps that generate time-based one-time passwords (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Push Notifications</strong>: Approve login attempts directly from your mobile device.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hardware Security Keys</strong>: Physical devices that connect to your computer or mobile device (e.g., YubiKey).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Biometrics</strong>: Fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice recognition.</p>
            
            <h4>MFA Effectiveness</h4>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>According to Microsoft, MFA can block over 99.9% of account compromise attacks. Even if an attacker has your password, they still need the second factor to gain access.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>When to Use MFA</h4>
            
            <p>Enable MFA whenever possible, especially for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Email accounts</li>
                <li>Financial services</li>
                <li>Cloud storage</li>
                <li>Social media</li>
                <li>Work accounts</li>
                <li>Any service containing sensitive information</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Biometrics and Other Authentication Methods</h3>
            <p>Biometric authentication uses unique physical characteristics to verify identity. While not a complete replacement for passwords, biometrics offer convenience and enhanced security when used as part of MFA.</p>
            
            <h4>Common Biometric Methods</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Fingerprint Recognition</strong>: Scans the unique patterns of your fingerprint.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Facial Recognition</strong>: Analyzes facial features and structure.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Voice Recognition</strong>: Identifies unique vocal patterns.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Iris/Retina Scanning</strong>: Examines the unique patterns in your eye.</p>
            
            <h4>Advantages of Biometrics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cannot be forgotten</li>
                <li>Difficult to duplicate or steal</li>
                <li>Quick and convenient</li>
                <li>Hard to share (intentionally or unintentionally)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Limitations of Biometrics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cannot be changed if compromised</li>
                <li>May have accuracy issues</li>
                <li>Requires specialized hardware</li>
                <li>Privacy concerns about biometric data storage</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Password Policies and Compliance</h3>
            <p>Organizations implement password policies to ensure consistent security practices across all users. These policies typically align with industry standards and regulatory requirements.</p>
            
            <h4>Common Password Policy Elements</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Minimum Length</strong>: Often 8-12 characters or more.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Complexity Requirements</strong>: Mix of character types.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Password Age</strong>: Maximum time before password change is required.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Password History</strong>: Preventing reuse of recent passwords.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Account Lockout</strong>: Temporarily locking accounts after multiple failed attempts.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Password Recovery</strong>: Secure methods for resetting forgotten passwords.</p>
            
            <h4>ISO 27001 Requirements</h4>
            
            <p>ISO 27001 includes several controls related to password management:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A.9.4.3: Password management system</li>
                <li>A.9.2.4: Management of secret authentication information</li>
                <li>A.9.3.1: Use of secret authentication information</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These controls require organizations to implement secure password practices and ensure users follow them.</p>
        </div>
