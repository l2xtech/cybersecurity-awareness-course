            <h3>Overview of Company Security Policies</h3>
            <p>Security policies provide a framework for protecting an organization's information assets:</p>
            
            <h4>Purpose of Security Policies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Identify and address security risks systematically.</li>

            <h4>Types of Security Policies</h4>

            <h4>ISO 27001 and Security Policies</h4>
            <p>ISO 27001 requires organizations to develop and implement a comprehensive set of security policies. These policies should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be approved by management</li>
                <li>Be communicated to all employees and relevant external parties</li>

                <li>Include specific controls and responsibilities</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Security policies are not just documents to be filed awayâ€”they are living guidelines that should inform your daily work activities and decisions.</p>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>Acceptable Use Policies</h3>
            <p>Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) define how employees may use company systems and resources:</p>

            <h4>Consequences of AUP Violations</h4>
            <p>Violations of acceptable use policies can lead to various consequences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verbal or written warnings</li>

            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
                <p>An employee at a financial services company used their work computer to download and install unauthorized software for personal use. The software contained malware that infected the company network, leading to a data breach affecting customer information. The employee was terminated for violating the acceptable use policy, and the company faced regulatory fines and reputational damage. This incident highlights the importance of following acceptable use policies to protect both the organization and its customers.</p>

            <h3>Clean Desk Policy</h3>
            <p>A Clean Desk Policy helps protect physical documents and information displayed on screens:</p>
            
            <h4>Key Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clear Desks</strong>: Keep desks free of sensitive documents when not in use.</li>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <p>A simple way to remember clean desk practices: If you're not actively using it, lock it up. If you're stepping away, even briefly, lock your screen.</p>

            <h3>Access Control Policies</h3>
            <p>Access control policies govern how access to systems and information is managed:</p>
            
            <h4>Principles of Access Control</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Least Privilege</strong>: Users should have only the minimum access needed to perform their job functions.</li>

                <li><strong>Separation of Duties</strong>: Critical tasks should be divided among multiple people to prevent fraud or errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Review</strong>: Access rights should be periodically reviewed and updated.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Access Management Lifecycle</h4>
            <ul>

            <h4>Authentication Methods</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Passwords</strong>: Traditional knowledge-based authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication</strong>: Combining multiple verification methods.</li>
